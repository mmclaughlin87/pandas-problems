    "- Observed Trend 1: Charter Schools have outperformed Districts Schools, with higher average scores in math and reading, and higher passing rates.\n",
    "- Observed Trend 2: Smaller schools have outperformed larger schools. Moving from large to medium to small schools, average scores and passing rates improve.\n",
    "- Observed Trend 3: Surprisingly, schools with lower spending per student have outperformed schools with higher spending per student. Perhaps the schools with larger budgets are being given additional funding to overcome poor scores."
